00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
A path of green grass with parallel wooden fences on either side moves straight toward the camera, then appears to curve upward and over a hill.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
The camera moves over the peak, and the path curves downward and briefly out of sight.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
The path reappears, curving straight toward the camera again, then curves upward and over a hill once more.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
The path curves downward from the second hill, then curves upward and sharply to the right.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.800
The path continues to curve to the right in a circular motion, bringing the camera back to its initial perspective, as if moving along a curved, elevated track.
