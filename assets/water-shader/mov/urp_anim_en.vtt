00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
The scene shows a deep blue body of water with a stylized white pirate ship model floating on the surface. The water has reflections and specular highlights, indicating a Universal Render Pipeline (URP) environment.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.500
The camera moves over a small wooden stilt house on a floating orange platform with various wooden poles surrounding it. The water surface is calm, with a subtle movement.

00:05.500 --> 00:09.500
The camera quickly pans past the stilt house and over the open water toward the horizon, revealing large, slow-moving waves.

00:09.500 --> 00:13.000
The camera moves back, focusing on the stylized ship. The waves are now more visible, causing the ship to slowly bob and tilt on the water surface.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
The camera dips down and then moves toward the stilt house again, now showing the wooden poles being dynamically displaced by the waves.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.500
A small brown boat near the stilt house is shown dramatically pitching and rolling in the waves.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.000
The camera pulls back to reveal both the ship and the stilt house in the distance, surrounded by the dynamically simulated waves.
