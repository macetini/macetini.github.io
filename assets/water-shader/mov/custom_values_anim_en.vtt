00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
The Unity editor is shown with a Game view and the Inspector. The water surface is dark blue with a floating boat and small object. The Inspector shows "Surface Inputs" for the custom water shader.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
The 'SurfaceColor' is quickly changed, cycling through yellow, red, and green. The water color updates instantly.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
The color is changed to pink, then back to a deep blue.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
The 'Wave1Amplitude' value is changed from 1.2 to 3. The waves in the scene immediately become much larger.

00:15.000 --> 00:22.000
The 'Wave1Steepness' is changed from 1 to 2. The waves become sharper and more defined, creating rougher water.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
The 'Wave2Wavelength' is changed from 90 to 140, increasing the distance between the secondary set of waves.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
The 'Wave2Amplitude' is changed from 1 to 4, making the secondary wave influence much higher.

00:32.000 --> 00:39.999
The 'Wave2Speed' is changed from 0.3 to 5, drastically increasing the speed of the secondary wave pattern, creating turbulent water movement. The small boat is violently tossed by the large, fast waves.
