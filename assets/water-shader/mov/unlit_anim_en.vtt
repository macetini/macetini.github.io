00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
The scene begins with a close-up of a dynamic, bright blue water surface in a 3D environment. Three gray objects—a large sphere, a vertical cylinder, and a cube—are partially submerged, bobbing in the waves.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.500
The camera slowly pans to the right and slightly back, revealing more of the water's surface detail and the foam generated around the sphere.

00:04.500 --> 00:07.000
The camera continues its movement, rotating around the central cube object and showing the cylinder in the background.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.500
The camera moves to a viewpoint behind the sphere, with the cube and cylinder visible on the far side of the water, which maintains its undulating motion.

00:09.500 --> 00:11.750
The camera completes its short pan, settling on a view where the sphere, cube, and cylinder are visible across the water, and the animation loops/ends.
