00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
The scene shows a light blue body of water with various simple 3D shapes (spheres, cubes, cylinders) floating or submerged, viewed from slightly above the water surface. The video is captured within the Unity editor's Game tab.

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
The water begins to move in large, gentle waves, causing the light blue surface to rise and fall.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
The waves grow larger and more pronounced, dynamically displacing the various floating geometric objects. Cubes, spheres, and cylinders are carried up and down and bob on the water.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.650
The wave motion continues, demonstrating a realistic water simulation in the scene.
