Welcome to my personal website!

## About

This site is my online portfolio and CV, designed to showcase my work, skills, and experience in software development and related fields. Here, you'll find:

- **Portfolio:** Projects I've built and contributed to, including code samples, demos, and write-ups.
- **CV/Resume:** My professional background, skills, education, and career highlights.
- **Contact:** How to get in touch with me for opportunities, collaborations, or questions.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to expand this site to include a blog, where I'll share my thoughts on programming, technology, and personal growth.

Stay tuned for updates!
