<p class="project-card-title">Lamp Website</p>

<p>
  LAMP Freelancing project, which was never finished, as the client decided not
  to proceed. Originally part of a greater CMS for managing and making
  reservations. The hosted project is incomplete and may not represent the final
  intended design. The code is available on my GitHub account.
