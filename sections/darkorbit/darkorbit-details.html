  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>
    DarkOrbit was the most challenging project I worked on during my time at
    Bigpoint Games. It required a deep understanding of both back end and front
    end development. I was responsible for implementing new features, fixing
    bugs, and optimizing the game's performance. I also worked closely with the
    design team to ensure that the game met the client's requirements and
    provided a satisfying user experience.
  </p>

  <h3>Responsibilities</h3>

  <p>
    It was my first role as a Game Developer, and not just sole front end. While
    the bulk of my work was on the front end, I also contributed to the back
    end. Mainly in the form of API development and database management. This was
    the most complex project I worked on at Bigpoint, and it taught me a lot
    about full stack development. There have been times when I would arrive at
    work a 8 in the morning and leave at 10 at night. But it was worth it, as I
    was able to learn a lot and contribute to a successful project.

  <h3>Big UI Redo</h3>

  <p>
    One of the biggest features I worked on was the complete redesign of the
    game's user interface. This was a massive undertaking that required a lot of
    coordination with the design team. I was responsible for implementing the
    new UI in Bigpoint internal custom framework, ensuring that it was both
    functional and visually appealing.
  </p>

  <p>
    The new logic included modifications on both back end and front end. This
    made it easier to manage and maintain. The new UI was a huge success, and it
    helped to improve the overall user experience.

  <h3>Multi-Item Sell System</h3>

  <p>
    The multi-item sell system was another significant feature I worked on. This
    system allowed players to sell multiple items at once and improving the
    overall user experience.
  </p>

  <figure class="project-item-container">

      href="assets/darkorbit/img/darkorbit_ui_redo_multysell.webp"

        class="project-image"
        src="assets/darkorbit/img/darkorbit_ui_redo_multysell.webp"
        alt="Multi-item Sell System Screenshot"
      />
    </a>

  </figure>

  <p>
    The system required a lot of work on both the back end and front end. We had
    user that accidentally bought 5000 items which would crash the client, as it
    was not intended for such use cases.
  </p>

  <h3>Other Features</h3>

  <p>
    A lot of other features were added to the game. Too many to list here. One
    of the notable ones was the jump system, which allowed players to jump from
    one system/server to another. It was a complex feature that required
    significant changes.
  </p>

  <h2>Server Merge</h2>

  <p>
    DarkOrbit conducted a series of server merges primarily in 2018. The merges
    were announced and took place in waves. All programmers in department were
    involved and did little else. Most of the work was done on the backend and
    the databases.
  </p>

  <figure class="project-item-container">
    <a
      href="assets/darkorbit/img/darkorbit_server_merge_list.webp"
      class="lightbox-trigger"

      <img
        class="project-image"

        alt="Server Merge List Screenshot"
      />
    </a>

  </figure>

  <p>
    The server merges were complex and required careful planning and execution
    to ensure a smooth transition for players. The merges involved combining
    player data, game progress, and in-game assets from multiple servers into a
    single server. This process required extensive testing and coordination with
    various teams within Bigpoint to minimize downtime and ensure data integrity.
