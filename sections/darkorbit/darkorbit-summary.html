<p>July 2017 - September 2019</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.darkorbit.com/" target="_blank">DarkOrbit</a> is an
  online browser game from
  <a href="https://bigpointgames.com/" target="_blank">Bigpoint Games</a> in
  which players can build and manage their own virtual spaceport. The game
  features various ships, weapons, and upgrades that players can use to explore
  the galaxy, complete missions, and engage in battles with other players.

<p>
  I worked on the development of the game's front-end and back-end features
  using ActionScript 3, Flash, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript and to lesser extent Java.
