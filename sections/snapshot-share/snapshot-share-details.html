  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>
    Mobile application developed for Samsung Bada platform using C++. The app
    captures images of text, processes them to remove noise, and uploads them to
    an external server. In return, it receives the sound of the said text.
  </p>

  <p>
    This application was part of my Master's thesis project, focusing on
    integrating OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and TTS (Text-to-Speech)
    technologies into a mobile application. The objective was to create a
    solution that would enable users to capture images of text, process them to
    remove noise, and upload them to an external server. In return, the app
    would receive the sound of the said text.
  </p>

  <p>
    The application is available on GitHub. Both with server side and client
    side code.
  </p>

  <p>The tech stack is quite old, and Samsung Bada OS has been deprecated.</p>
