  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>
    Few years ago, I found an old Java Project of mine from high school; a java
    implementation of the classic Tetris. It was on a old floppy disk, and I was
    curious to see if I could bring it back to life in a modern way. I decided
    to modernize it to Java 8 and improve the code structure.

  <p>
    The final result was then compiled to WebAssembly using
    <a href="https://cheerpj.com/">CheerpJ</a>, allowing it to run directly in
    web browsers without any plugins.
  </p>

  <p>
    The game features standard Tetris mechanics, including piece rotation,
    line clearing, and score tracking. The controls are mapped to the arrow
    keys for movement and rotation. Left/Right arrows move the pieces, Up arrow
    rotates them, and Down arrow speeds up their descent.
