  <a href="https://www.seafight.com/" target="_blank">Seafight</a> is a 2D
  browser-based multiplayer online game developed by

  using Flash. Players navigate the high seas, engaging in naval battles,
  completing missions, and earning rewards for their actions.

  I worked on the development of the game's front-end features using Flash,
  backend features using PHP and JavaScript/Html. Also, I did some work on a new
  Unity3D client.
