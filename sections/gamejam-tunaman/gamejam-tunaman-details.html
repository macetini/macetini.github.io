  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>
    Back in 2020, I participated in a 24-hour game jam and was a part of team
    that developed an Unity 2D platformer. The game challenges players to
    navigate through an infinite random generated level filled with obstacles
    and enemies. Despite the tight timeframe, we managed to implement core
    gameplay mechanics, design level, and create art assets. The experience
    honed my skills in rapid prototyping, time management, and creative
    problem-solving under pressure.

    The game was built using Unity, leveraging its 2D capabilities to create
    engaging platforming mechanics. We focused on simple controls and responsive
    gameplay to ensure a fun experience within the limited time. The Player
    horizontal movement was controlled with a burst of force by Left and Right
    Mouse Clicks, while jumping was handled with the Spacebar. The level
    generation algorithm created a series of platforms, obstacles, and enemies,
    ensuring that each play through offered a unique challenge.
