<p>October 2014 - July 2017</p>

<p>
  Zoomomba was a social multiplayer online game developed by
  <a href="https://www.bigpoint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >Bigpoint GmbH</a
  >
  using Flash and ActionScript 3. The game is currently inactive, but it was a
  fun project to work on. We gave it all before it went offline in 2017.
</p>

<p>
  I worked on the development of the game's front-end features using
  ActionScript 3 and Flash, collaborating closely with the development team.
